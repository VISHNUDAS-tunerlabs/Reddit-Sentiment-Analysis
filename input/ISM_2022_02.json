      "If you think that paying an income tax on your salary is ok, then why shouldn't the government tax your investment gains. Both are products of your labour. The point of income tax is to punish or penalise achievement no matter how big or small they are. Now coming to 80c this is how socialism works. When a socialist government comes to power they need to control their citizens, what best to control men than to say what is good and what is bad. So the government says do these things and you will not be taxed. Simple.",

      "In the first place, am not totally okay with paying 20% of income as tax. That's why I asked why there is a limit on 80c. I can't digest the fact that gains are taxed as well. Does it apply even when you sell the share? Say you buy 1000 share at 50 rs and after a few years, the value increases crazily, reaches 200rs/ share and you wanna sell it. &gt;The point of income tax is to punish or penalise achievement no matter how big or small they are Haha, Is this a sarcasm?",

      "We are all unhappy to be paying tax, but when a government says they are going to tax something, always assume the principle would be extended to cover other things as well. It sucks I know, let us not discuss politics though. Yes unfortunately it applies to selling of shares as well, until 2019 there was a loophole that applied to foreign securities but now that is gone as well. Again not something I am happy about but something I write off as cost of doing business. I was trying to be serious and not resort to sarcasm on the intention of IT. If you see how income taxes were justified when they were first brought into a republic, it was temporary. Well now it is anything but that.",

      "I am not a pro. I started reading about market just 5 month back. Whatever I wrote above is my philosophy. Invest to create wealth. How to earn money? Do trading, futures and options. If you want to earn from investments, try to buy at low. Then sell at high. Try to find some undervalued stocks. Or just buy some shares with good future which can give you good profit. example- if you want to invest now and withdraw after 6 months. Good shares will be Lal pathlabs(1200 down from high), Tata Power, Tata Motors, Tata Elxsci,TCS, Wipro, Sigachi,etc. Then there is ITC which can give 4x-7x return, the day fmcg business demerge. JP power can give 200% return as it is reducing it's debt every quarter. These are just examples. Just spend some time studying shares. You can earn money too. Though I don't support these ideas",

      "What are your financial goals? (Home, children's education / daughter's marriage / foriegn travel/ retirement corpus / want to get crazy rich to smoke cocaine of hot chick's bums). This will determine the sort of investment horizon are you looking at. Once you get in there, you will be able to determine your risk appetite. For example, if your goal is something only 2-3 years into the future, you would have less risk apetite. If it's something 40 Yeats away (retirement), then you can take a lot of risk trying to enter in early stage high growth businesses that may give you a lot of returns over decade. The determine how much time can you give to your investment portfolio. If all you wanna do is to save money and not bother much coz you got your job to do, invest your money in FDs. Ok just kidding, you never ever fucking put money in FDs except 6 months emergency corpus. Once that is there, you can begin your investment journey. So we talked about no frills investment, you can go for an Index Fund that may give you 12-15 percent returns. Get a monthly SIP and be consistent. If you can invest a bit more time, perhaps you should look into direct stocks but deal only with large cap good stocks which are guaranteed to grow but at a not so fast pace). If you got more time, you may look into some mid cap exposure given your risk apetite allows it. Feel like a second coming for buffet, you can spend considerable time reading about companies, annual reports tracking screenr filters in hope of finding growth stocks that might give you 25 percent per annum. For this, you will have to consistently follow companies and get in when they are undervalued. As they say, buy the fucking dip. I would have talked about day trading and futures as well but there are nicer places to donate money like charities, Akshay patra etc. After doing all this, you would then finally settle on how much money do you need to put in the market on a monthly / yearly basis. If this is too much money, recalibrate and so forth.",

But if you want to invest in ELSS then reduce some portion from Flexicap/Multicap as almost all ELSS funds are Multicap in nature and fund managers are very comfortable as Lock-in of 3 years give them great cushion. 3. Debt Part : If you want a safe portfolio, go for pure debt fund otherwise go for some good hybrid fund. 4. Do not blindly invest, look at fund manager's history and look at rolling returns since fund manager has started, expense ratio (although daily NAV is updated after accounting expense ratio) and AMC's history.",

So my questions are 1. How do they know am an NRI , my demat was opened when I wasn't an NRI , so how do they know and how much would they deduct ? 2. I have no income in India apart from these dividends , so obviously my tax slab would be the lowest as these dividends would come around to 1.2 lakhs only , so that means my tax slab is 0% , with that being the case the TDS would be fully refunded right ? Whether it be 10% or 20% , it would be fully refunded right ?",

And finally running a EV cost same as petrol vehicle. Ever wondered why piped LPG cost less? It cost less since govt want people to switch from cilinder to piped gas and once it is done then they will increase the price.

      "Smallcase is something built for easy access of stocks for everyone u can login using ur Groww account. There will be many baskets available which are created by market experts. All u have to do is select the basket u are comfortable with. U can decide which one to select by looking at the CAGR of basket. U can also modify the weightage of stocks present in the basket (e.g; If u have selected a basket which invests in nifty mid cap and nifty small cap u can set how much percentage of ur invested money in that basket to invest in either one of them ). So still if u cant find one check CANSLIM-esque. Personally I am not investing in this smallcase. Good Luck Investing",

      "No. It is not a blueship stock. It is a mid cap company, a low mid cap that too. So, it have a high growth potential. Though I won't guarantee it. How I found it? I already wrote above. Check those criteria. Then read about company business. Then I try to think for myself. If I am convinced,I buy it. The company make oleochemicals products means the chemicals derived from fat. That's not special. But it makes fat out of only plant fats. That makes the company special. Only few companies does that. Plus these oleochemicals are used in food products. Using fine organics oleochemicals makes a food vegetarian or vegan. What these oleochemicals do? They basically increase the shelf life of food, it dictates the texture of a food, increase resistance against fungus,etc. What is texture of food? Cruchyness,fluffiness etc. So ya. That's just one part. They are in plastic, cosmetics and many other industries. I can't explain everything here. The thing is that it have very less competition in India. And I am pretty sure you are using the company product almost everyday, like good day biscuits. So ya that's all. Yes the share price is high. I wish I had money to buy it. But I don't have. Don't take my words, read about it yourself. Because, until you study about the thing yourself, you won't be surviving bear market. I have a list of many such companies. I wish I had money.",

It also proposes that no individual can outperform a group of stocks over a long time. The other two features of the efficient market hypothesis are that stock prices are random (no trend) and nobody can time them consistently. Opposite of the efficient market hypothesis is \"reflexivity\" proposed by George Soros. It says market prices are always wrong, hover either above or below the median, and always deviates from its fundamentals.

      "We usually add ₹150k on April 1 in PPF to avail complete benefit of the scheme. However, on March 31, 2021, government announcement that they'd be reducing PPF rate from 7.1% to 6.4%. By the time they reversed this decision, we'd already made up our mind to move to ELSS fund for 80C benefit. Because let's be honest, by the time this PPF matures, the rate will be closer to 6% or 5% anyway. So we add ₹500 in PPF now and the rest in Quant Tax Plan.",

Don't fall into the trap of recency bias. If you look into a time span of 10 years, hardly 2-5% of funds can beat the index. You can diversify and have index plus active funds in your portfolio. You can revisit the funds after 2-3 years and rebalance the MF portfolio according to their performances. Keep investing a small portion into stocks by yourself. You will learn a lot on the way.",

I would suggest you to build emergency fund (in case you haven't), until you build it allocate more money in emergency fund than any thing else. Then, you can divide between mutual funds and stocks depending on your knowledge and comfort. But go for some sort of asset allocation like 70% in stocks, 25% debt, 5% gold something like this. It would help you in protecting your hard earned money (harder to invest in Debts and Gold in a Bull run but give a read about the importance of asset allocation and the comparison of total CAGR with and without asset allocation, you would be surprised, you can read in r/IndiaInvestments).",

      "This is a very popular stock among small brokers. I had 500 shares it at 520, then sold it recently at 654. But at some point, it had even touched 800. What had always bothered me was an extremely high PE ratio of the stock. People have given a target of 1000 before this year on the basis of a very strong order book. What I am not sure how are these high levels of PE are justified with that target? I will reenter this stock only if it crosses its previous high of 820. This is purely a momentum stock that rises more and more when it is rising. But it turns into falling knife when falling. This is probably because there is lot of Mutual fund and institution interest in this stock.",

For 5 to 8 years horizon this woukd give better return (Expected) and expense ratio is also very little than other funds. You can also look for large cap funds or flexicap funds. Both are also good for 5 to 8 years horizon and should expectedly give good return. But expense ratio will be higher than index fund and you may need to track the performance of fund periodically (quarterly or hakf yearly). List of index fund: https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/performance-tracker/sip-returns/index-fundsetfs.html List of largecap funds: https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/performance-tracker/sip-returns/large-cap-fund.html List of flexicap fund: https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/performance-tracker/sip-returns/flexi-cap-fund.html",

      "Mutual funds are much simpler, can be set in auto mode with few clicks and once in a while you can check your portfolio. Index funds are like average/benchmark of many Mutual funds. SIP in a nifty50 index fund(Indian market) and S&amp;P500 Index fund(US Market) for lazy and still efficient returns. There are star fund managers/cyclical funds/strategy funds who/which produce slightly better returns with little more risk. But those require more research like in depth knowledge of macro economics, star manager profiles etc For example 1. UTI Nifty 200 momentum 30 index fund has outperformed in rising market 2. Mutual funds from star managers like R Srininvasan from sbi smallcap fund, Prashant jain from hdfc, Rajeev Thakkar of ppfas have outperformed nifty 3. Commodity funds in inflation theme give mammoth returns For ETFs , you need to login into trading portal/app , buy same etf every month. You need to place bid order and ensure it executes and same goes for selling. Your etf selection should have liquidity all time, less tracking error, etc . One drawback is it could tempt you into trading. There are some strategy etfs but variety is much lower compared to Mutual funds It is possible to automate buying etfs in few brokers like zerodha but other might not have that feature. Tldr: Prefer mutual funds in India.",

      "It definitely is, I use it too and it is really good.",
      "Many brokers now have single click portfolios. They will replicate the any index or various collection of stocks. Some even auto rebalance. If you want to your money to grow all you need is 4 hours a month for investing in market leaders &amp; tracking them. With any brokerage you can create a auto SIP. If you will not be able to spend 4 hours a month then go for any etf that replicates the index. MFs are usually behind the flock &amp; due to policy they can’t keep cash so they have to keep buying. That is one reason I never go for them. Even when they want to sell in a falling market the quantities they hold can’t be disposed off. I have more then 70% of my saving in Equity. I buy only market leaders who have monopolistic business. There are months when I don’t even login into my portfolio as I mainly track news with google alerts. In fact out of that 4 hours most of my time now goes in US stocks portfolio which I am trying to build. Best option go for a ETF with 90% of your money &amp; buy one share with 10% of it. See if you can take out 4 hours a month. If not 3 months later sell it &amp; buy more of the ETf. Stock market is all about trying &amp; learning.",
      "I would say both are good options. With mutual funds, you will have less stress compared to ETFs. You can start an auto SIP and forget it for next 5-10 years. With both Mutual Funds and ETFs, you will be investing a fixed amount on monthly basis, so you will have the benefit of compounding. Index funds are safer because they have strong, bluechip companies listed in it. History shows that Index funds have consistently risen over the years. There is less expense ration in ETFs than mutual funds. Investing in stocks via mutual funds/ETF is the lowest risk you can take.",
      "When any stock has high number of shares, they are always listed with high PE due to their market cap and growth prospects. If the stocks keeps performing nicely over the years, its PE will be reduced significantly, but I don't see that happening before 3-5 years. This looks very expensive considering the high PE, compared to its peers, industry and index. FIIs and DIIs have reduced their stake in last 3 quarters. Quarterly performance of this stock wasn't really flat too.",

      "You going with ETF or MFs your not looking for short term trading neither are you looking to double your money every year with high risk bets. Your looking for beat most investment assets &amp; make anywhere between 10 to 17 % pa and use Power of compounding. ( The real secret to wealth generation) If you select market leaders with good governance you will notice that these companies are always expensive but will always grow slightly higher then the index. Plus Many of these companies like TCS, HDFCtwins, Asian paints, Reliance etc are like FDs. These companies don’t collapse over night &amp; don’t double over night. On average every year their share price grows 20 to 25 % You can use tools like screener.in to see stock price cagr. Monitoring of these stocks doesn’t need anything. Every quarter you read their results. See management notes if any. Set google alerts for any news about the company or interview of management. Also you don’t need to buy companies continuously. I maybe buy 1 or 2 very year when there are market collections. Till then hold savings in railway or tax free bonds. If your doing sip that step won’t be necessary plus you will need little experience there. Compared to ETF this will help you make a few percent more per year. Now just to see the value of 2% per year more for 20 years use any compounding returns calculator. Also factor the cost of MFs over same period in one of your calculations. Since you are new many of these things will feel confusing that’s why I suggested put 90% in ETF &amp; 10 percent in one stock. As your confidence increases you can start your transition.",

      "First of all. Longterm investors don’t mean Value investor. Lol. Value is simply discovering a security trading at a price lower than its intrinsic value and buying that share and selling it when the prices meet its value. If price and value matches in a few months, a value investor in theory would sell such security at that point. Not really long term is it? Its a gross misconception that only value investing can be Longterm. No. Momentum can be long term. If you stick to your principles and follow your strategy long term? You are a long term investor. Same applies for Growth. Tesla was trading at ridiculous valuations 3-4 years ago. Growth investors who believed in it held on despite that and look where it’s at now. Long term investment by growth investors. Now coming to your question, the market goes through cycles. There will always be periods of outperformance and underperformance for each strategy. Growth investing shines in early phases of market cycles, momentum o it performs in mid cycles, and in later phases of the cycle, value me outperform. So how do you navigate these market cycle’s without trying and always failing to time the market? Diversify in strategies and not stocks. Just buying 20 stocks is not enough diversification ,specifically if 10 of the 20 stocks are Adani , Happiest mind, tanla etc. Thats basically riding the momentum. Diversify b/w strategies. 1. first and foremost have a Passive Portfolio. It will basically comprise of Index funds or ETFs. No matter how good a fund manager you are, you are likely going to underperform the Index in the long run. So better to ride along with the index. 2. Have a Factor based strategy. What is factor? Well it can be anything : Momentum, Growth, Low Volatility. A factor will have period of outperformance ( eg. how we saw momentum outperform everything in the last 2 years) in which you will make most of your profits. But in other times, the factor will underperform. Hence the importance of first step and building an Index Portfolio",

Your profits of last 6 months can vanish in few days if the crash (Dotcom Bubble, Covid, Scams, Recessions). It is better to be invested in index funds, it does correct when the market is down, but it recovers too and continues its movement.

      "Yes. Wealth is created in bear markets. No one can time when the bear market is gonna turn around so you have to be diligent putting money regularly in fundamentally good investment options because it's only during bear markets that they are available to you at a discount price. The question you have to ask yourself is that whichever money I'm putting my stocks in, will it be able to withstand the economic downturn and recover afterwards? Large companies with strong fundamentals too. The biggesr companies, which form the indexes also do that's why you might want to increase percentages of index funds. Then, you have to look at economic climate and make decisions. With interest rates bound to go up, you want to pull money out of companies which have a heavy debt. These are basically capital intensive industry stocks like automobiles / infra. You also might want to reduce companies whose profits might be effected by crude prices. And just move away from growth stocks which are cash guzzlers and not profitable right now as they might suffer to expand during recession owing to less liquidity.",

Tata motors will do free service by establishing EV by educating consumers &amp; building infra but other foreign companies like Tesla, Apple, Sony etc might benefit from this. If you think, Tata motors doesn't have any capabilities when it comes to tech like autonomous driving, electric battery or big data but companies like Apple, Tesla have them.

Ltts is in a field where entry barrier is high. Only competitor is tata elxsi. Ltts has r&amp;d on emerging techs like EV, 5g,semiconductor, self drive, automation and more.

That's why, investment in equity market should be for ling term - for 5-10 years. If your goal has less time than that, gradually shift to fixed income or debt instruments. 3. You cannot time the market. So, SIP is a better way to average it out. Don't wait for the dip. You can always invest in lumpsum during dips but your investment plan cannot be around dips. 4. Invest in index funda for long term as index funds generally follow the economy of the country and hopefully, the latter will grow eventually.

This chart should be viewed along the lines of basic MaxPain Theory. As per MaxPain theory, stock or index will expire at the point where it gives maximum pain to option buyers. So if spot price is close to MaxPain, wait for the direction to trade. But if price is too far away from MaxPain, then we need to look for reversal trades. We can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) too far away from MaxPain. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early.

Although, I have been reading reports which says that entry to this stock would be ideal at around 250-270 for long term, after it has corrected. Correction is inevitable, not sure how much. On the other hand, lots of mutual funds has made an entry, but since the number of stock is gigantic, there will be lots of sellers too. High Volume and High Volatility is all there is for now. It can either make you or break you. Choice is yours.",

Since index options are cash settled, you would have made a profit and the size of the profit would have depend on how far below the strike does Nifty close at. As another person has explained in the comments, if Nifty were to close between 17593 - 17600 then you won't make a net profit since the cash payout would not have covered what you paid in terms of premium. However if Nifty closed below 17593 then you would have made a net profit give by: (17593 - closing price) * 50",

Okay, Vardhacrlc, this one, I wouldn't invest in that level where you got in. I will avoid this one at the current level. Note: You entered in risky penny stocks and as you mention you are a beginner, these kinda trades need higher skills, especially good experience in market psychology. Please avoid investing a huge amount based on others' recommendations. If it was learning purposes then seeing losses on \"a negligible amount of money\" shouldn't worry you. And don't expect to see profits any sooner. it may take weeks or even months. Patience is the key here. If you don't feel confident, if you are not good with seeing 20-30-40 or even 50% losses then you should exit right away. Pro tip I believe 2022 is gonna be a full year of a bear market, meaning all those \"good, great\" stocks will fall or start trade in a range, all those shitty stocks like Yes bank, Rbl bank, Idea, ITC, Suzlon, Rel.

      "Stop this nonsense of dip-buying. Breaking of an important swing low on a historically overvalued market is a sure way to be a long-term bag holder, not an intelligent investor. Sure, you can not time the market, you don't have even have to. When a forward 10Y expected return is in negative territory, and the price is breaking swing low, even the dumbest fundamentalist and reckless gamblers know efficient market hypothesis is on the verge of bankruptcy in nearby turn. ---- Edit: No, low-interest rates don't justify overvaluation. Low rates mean a bad economy and lower expected corporate profits. So a high ROE company in the past turns into a low ROE disaster. Cashflows are much less predictable than the price. So paying as less than small to nothing is the key to the margin of safety No, a higher dividend doesn't justify valuation either. It takes a -20% drop of an asset to produce a net negative return No, valuation matters, and it's not subjective. It might not work on Amazon, but it works on the majority of stocks. For every Amazon, there were 100s of bankrupt pets.com. Your chances of buying a profitable moat are statistically slimmer than an average day trader with a profitable account.

      "so my dad's average for 2001 to 2019 is 22% annually. Since 2020, I stepped in with my salary and half of our family portfolio eventually since i was making profits. I'm a software engg, I made my custom screeners and research stuff, I follow the numbers, volatility, quantity available and then divide the portfolio to 10-20 stocks minimum in opposite sectors, and opposite valuations. This is the smarter part of the trick. Fmcg vs IT, Finance vs Something else, You have to figure out which sector is performing opposite of whom... over a course of few weeks, or some specific events. Like pharma was positive, IT was dumping recently but Ongc type stocks were up back then. Also, large cap stocks behave opposite to penny on most dumpings or market bloodbaths, so one day nets or something can be possible. Also, like sigar industry is positive recently, If you're reading me from quite sometime, I've already cried about the huge losses we took in RANASUGAR, Hodling it for 15 years since we were wayyy to angry to even book losses and selling it few months before it shot up in ethanol boom to 5x its price. So you have to figure out what wave is riding high and which batch of stocks are affected and act accordingly.

So, whenever I look for new trade, I will check where the price is currently at. If the price is between resistance and support, no new trades are allowed. But when price moves closer towards Blue &amp; Orange lines (resistance and support), we can look for new trading opportunities and can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) near the resistance or support. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early. That's how I use it personally but can be interpreted and used in many ways.",

      "If the market is favorable, then the small cap funds will beat the CAGR compared to other funds each time. Small caps stocks with good growth and good fundamentals tend to give good returns over a short term period compared to large/midcap and bluechip stocks, although the risk is higher too since when the market is down, these stocks sometimes get an LC. Investing in small cap individual stocks will give you the best return considering you have picked up good stocks with strong company financials and are on their path to growth and profit with decreasing debt. Small cap funds won't always give the same return each year. It can very well fluctuate from year to year if you stay long term, but if you will do SIP, then the compounding will still generate better returns in the time span of 3-5 years. I would say you should balance between both small cap funds and direct stocks. That way your risk is reduced as well as there is a chance of good profit. However, since you mentioned that you have high risk appetite, you can invest in direct stocks but do you research before picking up stocks as wrong stocks bought at the wrong time can destroy your wealth in few months. I myself follow the same strategy. I have invested in Nippon India Small Cap and have few small cap stocks in my portfolio as well.",

Lots of bluechip stocks have been giving consistent returns of around 10-15% per year so its easy to make money if you have nice stocks with long term perspective. Diversifying your portfolio in different sectors, picking stocks with good fundamentals. Stocks that are current undervalued, and patience to stay invested for long term can give you good returns over the years. You can stay invested and get the benefit of compounding or you can exist when your stocks have given certain returns over time. Your yearly return will increase if you invest in momentum stocks with high growth in short term. You just have to know when to exist. I know people who earn 50-70% returns every year from stocks.",

      "Margins in the food delivery business extremely slim in India. When I lived in the Middle East, I had to shell out at least Rs.150 per delivery. However, in India most customers are unwilling to pay anything beyond Rs.25-30 per delivery. If you understand the fundamentals of food delivery business then you'll see why food delivery is not viable in India. Countries where the model has been relatively successful have markets with high labour cost. However, in India labour is dirt cheap and economically it doesn't make sense for restaurants to pay a 25-30% comission on every order. They might as well keep delivery boys on their payroll. As for the discovery part, a lot of new startups are already innovating on this front. Moving away from the fundamentals, my sources tell me that the moratorium on Zomato's ESOP pool expires this year. Also a lot of private investors who had participated in the pre-IPO round will be eligible to sell their stocks. So there will be a huge supply hitting the market this year. If you really believe in Zomato then it's better to sell this stock on rise and buy when the company commands a realistic valuation that is comparable to its performance.",

      "We are all noobs. We are all learning. I am not expert either, but here is what I think it is. Low promoter holding doesn't mean the stock is bad. When the grows and becomes large, you have so many buyers who want a stake in the company. Sometimes, company give their stake to them at certain determined price, which reduces their share holding. If the shareholding is divided in good amounts between promoters, DII, FII and public, it isn't really an issue, since there is huge amount of common stock available. However, some companies have very low shareholding without any reason. It happens because either the company is in debt or company is not able to manage effectively and they issue huge part of their holding to other investors or institutions, so those companies can be very bad investment. Reverse can happen where companies have more than 80% holding to themselves. In that case, there are less shares floating in the market unless the common number of stock is very high for there to be enough for retail investors. Usually, the share holding between 50-70 percent is considered ideal since it leaves enough stock to be there for FII/DII and retail investors.",

Were you aware that your 10Y expected return was just 16% unless there's phenomenal growth (which is hard to estimate accurately) in the company? PS: I am a speculator, not an investor but having some common sense helps survive financial markets. TA is fine but even if someone is off the chart, for a company growing at 15% year on year, to get the full value of the company, he needs to pay below 7x operating earnings. That way he will get back his full value after 4.8 years.

This chart should be viewed along the lines of basic MaxPain Theory. As per MaxPain theory, stock or index will expire at the point where it gives maximum pain to option buyers. So if spot price is close to MaxPain, wait for the direction to trade. But if price is too far away from MaxPain, then we need to look for reversal trades. We can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) too far away from MaxPain. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early.

But when price moves closer towards Blue &amp; Orange lines (resistance and support), we can look for new trading opportunities and can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) near the resistance or support.

      "Basically the mutual fund invests the AUM into stocks of their choosing. The NAV is basically the index of value of the basket of stocks that the fund invested in. Think of it like buying a stock (whose price is the same as the nav) whose value will fluctuate over time. When returns of 10-12-15-18% CAGR are advertised, it doesn’t mean that your money grows a certain % every year and is reinvested. The CAGR is simply the avg % return that is calculated. Eg: stock goes from 100 to 144 in 2 years. CAGR is 20%. But it doesn’t go from 100 to 144 in a straight line. At some point the price could even be below 100. it is also entirely possible that the stock traded around Rs 80 for 1.5 years and then shot up to 144 in 6 months. This is why it is important to stay invested over the long run. If you panic and withdraw your funds (sell the stock) prematurely, you may not receive the potential CAGR (or you may even lose money).",

Under the terms of the reverse merger, Equitas SFB will issue 226 shares for every 100 shares of Equitas Hold Co. Price of Equitas Hold Co. on 18.02.22 is Rs. 111.95 and Equitas SFB is Rs. 53.40. Value of 100 shares of Equitas Hold Co. = Rs. 11195.00 Value of 226 shares of Equitas SFB = Rs. 12068.40 Investing in Equitas Hold Co. will give you an arbitrage of acquiring Equitas SFB shares at Rs. 49.5 per share.

Number of jobs coming our way will reduce significantly, would you disagree ? You might want equal wages but thats not how it works. I guess you want it both ways don't you ? This too is retative, like every thing else. We are getting paid UNTIL we are paid less than our equally best alternative, that's your strongest moat. Once it's gone, may be next phase of jobs will flow to Africa's way. So, all said and done, I ask again, any comparative data of wage distribution will bring us nearer to the truth.

      "Markets are irrational. Trading based on events can backfire many times since you cannot time the perfect entry. It can go sideways or upside for few sessions before going down. So if you playing in derrivatives specially in index I would suggest DO NOT buy option next week expiry overnight. Give it a more theta time. Data is somewhat netural. Market likely will open a gap down Monday before a pullback and then new data you should keep an eye on. BNF can touch 37k and that should be your exit at least 75% qty. For overnight positions, I would always put AMO order at the targets you expecting. By the way, you can still play events even if it's big gap down opening. What I would like is confirmation from Friday data, Monday global sentiments and where market is opening then I would put AMO order at those levels. It's much better than worrying about overnight positions on weekends. Good luck OP.",

The rest of oil exporters realize since supply is less they can jack up prices...calm. 5. India being a net crude importer country will see profits for it's companies shrink due to higher transportation costs / raw material costs,,,,panik 6.

      "Whatever you have written here is completely unrelated to your previous comment of contradiction. However, I do have a piece of advice for you in line of what you have written here. People with your line of thinking usually get taken advantage of a lot. I work for a European company sitting in India and I get paid the same as my colleagues in Europe. It is actually the fault of Indian education system in instilling this slave mentality you have thinking that you don’t deserve the same as your masters. Ask for more if you want more.",
      "Dow Jones futures you mean right?",
      "Value, trend &amp; momentum - these three are robust strategies, so changing the geography and asset class will and should not change the performance (unless the market is strongly efficient - but then nothing will work). You can see how value in the Japanese market outperformed. I don't see why it would not work in India. However, during a bear market, value also faces a similar drawdown - it's just the bounce that value enjoyed historically. https://www.netnethunter.com/japanese-net-nets-fantastic-or-foolish/ https://viniyogindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nifty500-Value50-12Y-performance.png In India, I have only data since 2009, but my smooth equity curve came from an antifragile level of tail risk management (addition of time-series momentum) with the expense of volatility premium combined with robust strategies, such as global value investing (US+India). As a result, I have achieved 6.3% CAGR with 6% maximum drawdown whereas only value on average had 4.5% CAGR with superior drawdown within the same period. So even if value investing can not outperform a bear market, there is no expected systematic tail risk (risk of the bag holding for overestimation of future cashflows - systematic error) in my strategy. Talking about Graham's Cigar Butt style (buying stocks below its liquidation value), there is no way to claim whether it works or not here, because India hasn't seen the 1929 - 1940s level of consolidation in the last 10 years. Maybe some pre-2003 level data will work where there was not much liquidity, but I don't have such old data, so I can not reliably backtest it without some overfitting bias. [My Strategy](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1r1vJZ80Z7I) &gt; And do you think a year or a year and a half of the bear market will cover up for 13 years of underperformance? I have zero doubts about it. I challenge growth guys here. Let's see after a full 20Y economic cycle. It's a bet. What will happen or not happen, only time will determine. I prefer to step on the probable outcome that is backed by historical events and not shake hands with the \"trust the FED\" post-2009 Dalal Street paradigm. So good luck for those \"buy the index and hold forever\" guys.",
      "Thanks, a noob here just picked up based on expense ratio and some performance decided to go with the flexi and IT funds the hybrid and hdfc were more towards keeping emergency funds probably will stop them after some time.",
      "For emergency fund:- use fixed deposits or liquid funds as that's money you need instantly(Eg medical emergencies). Short term funds can take up to 4-5days to give you your money back. Eg you redeem after hours on Friday. Flexicap is a good bet(if you trust the funds manager) IT funds are thematic bets and wouldn't recommend those to a \"noob\" as you've called yourself. Can't comment on hybrid funds as emergency money(because I'd rather not use abusive language here. 🤣)",
      "Most probably nothing. Our companies don't benefit from Russia. USA and Europe aren't dumb. They are seeing inflation rise after 40 years. They will remove sanction from Iran and probably US will increase the production to more than 13 million barrels per day. But there will be panic selling which imo is a good buying opportunity.",

      "OP, this advice is gold. I was exactly going to say this. Good strategy would be to diversify. Here's my suggestion: Largecap - invest in index funds (nifty50 and next 50). Largecap active mutual funds like Axis one you have seldom generate a lot of alpha and you end up paying a higher expense ration. Choose good midcap and smallcap funds. Multicaps are good as well but be sure to analyse overlap in overall portfolio. I recently analysed my portfolio to overhaul and found 12% of my portfolio was on HDFC and 10% was on TCS which way over exposure. Hope this helps.",

You have to research a bit and find out getting a tax exempt on income is beneficial for you based on the tax regime you follow and the other factors, there are calculator for that in websites like cleartax etc. But if you are sure that getting tax exempt is better then elss is the best option in my opinion.

The buyback will be at 4,500 (CMP:3730). To qualify for retail category you need to hold less than 2 lakh worth of shares. You will have to tender the shares via your broker when TCS announces the buyback window. While the exact date of the buyback window is not announced this will probably be in a few weeks. Retail acceptance for the last few buybacks was 100%, but it will likely be less this time around due to higher retail interest.",

You will also learn - microeconomics, macroeconomics, accounting, business models, different industries, etc etc. This will be like a mini MBA.

      "How do I use this data? The Orange graph in the chart represents spot price and the Blue graph represents it's MaxPain value. This chart should be viewed along the lines of basic MaxPain Theory. As per MaxPain theory, stock or index will expire at the point where it gives maximum pain to option buyers. So if spot price is close to MaxPain, wait for the direction to trade. But if price is too far away from MaxPain, then we need to look for reversal trades. We can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) too far away from MaxPain. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early. That's how I use it personally but can be interpreted and used in many ways.",

      "Buy Index during dips like NiftyBeES. Stock picking is worth it only if you have some significant amount like 50k. But if you want to learn now to buy more in future then its a different story in which case you can buy any number of stocks possible with your amount. How many you can buy solely depends on the companies (their CMP) you are picking. In any case, don’t buy penny stocks just because you have a small amount and wish to get a large number of shares. And don’t have more than 20-30 stocks in portfolio.",
      "Yes you can keep buying before buyback opens, during buyback or after buyback ends. No restrictions in you buying from the market. The only risk with buyback is acceptance ratio. The number of shares the company will accept from you depends on demand. So if acceptance ratio is 50% half of your shares will be accepted (bought) by the company and remaining half will be returned to you in your demat account. Now if you bought shares for the purpose of buyback only and if the stock price falls you will see losses on your remaining shares that were not accepted. However this is a loss only if you sell your remaining shares at below your average price. If you are a long term investor and its a strong company you can hold so it doesn't matter. I have put half my savings in TCS buyback recently i.e. bought TCS on Monday which was the last date for buyback. Expected return is around 20% in one month. Let's see how much acceptance ratio we see this time. It was 100% in previous 3 buybacks and people made a lot of easy money.",

I am not a trader though so take my words with a pinch of salt. I am a long term investor who started recently and am looking to buy dips of blue chip companies and the index this year. Are you trading Nifty or some particular stock? In swing trading, what profit (in %) is needed to make a net profit (after all charges and taxes)?

      "Company announces a buy back and its buying price first. On the same day of a few days later company will announce a record date. You need to have shares of that company in your DEMAT account on record date. For this you have to buy shares 2 days before record date as in India it is T+2 system - i.e. if you buy shares on Monday they are delivered to your DEMAT on Wednesday. On record date company will check who all are its shareholders and all those are eligible to participate in the buyback. For example today is the record date of TCS buyback so those who bought on Monday or before will be eligible. Tender (buyback) opens few days later in which you have to tender your shares i.e. apply for selling your shares to the company. You can do this via your broker like Zerodha. Few days later company will announce how much shares they have accepted i.e. acceptance ratio which is based on demand. Also note that if your total value of shares (of this particular company) is more than 2L you will be considered as general category which has a very low acceptance ratio. So if you are trying to participate in a buyback try to ensure the value of your holdings on record date is less than 2L in which case you will be considered in retail category and acceptance ratio is good here.",

I regret not participating in previous TCS buybacks as it was easy money. I am no expert. I learnt everything about buybacks recently and even for me this is my first buyback. Good luck to us!",

This chart should be viewed along the lines of basic MaxPain Theory. As per MaxPain theory, stock or index will expire at the point where it gives maximum pain to option buyers. So if spot price is close to MaxPain, wait for the direction to trade. But if price is too far away from MaxPain, then we need to look for reversal trades. We can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) too far away from MaxPain. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early.

Invest in knowledge first. Please dm for course suggestions. This will help you identify good businesses with great fundamentals. 3) Learn how to be in control of your emotions.

      "Goldman Sachs view on oil: Oil: near-term disruptions unlikely We don’t believe sanctions are likely to be imposed on oil flows, either, as unilateral US/Europe sanctions would likely have only a limited impact on Russia, given its ability to divert oil flows, but would still leave Europe with the daunting challenge of sourcing alternative supplies to the ~2.5 mb/d of crude/condensate Russia sends to the continent, as well as the ~1.5 mb/d of petroleum products. We estimate that Russia’s main ports currently have almost 1 mb/d of spare capacity, enough to redirect a potentially large portion of the current European-Russian pipeline flows, a flexibility displayed during the Druzhba pipeline contamination in April 2019. This scenario would instead be most impactful on freight markets rather than crude prices, creating a pull on dirty tankers comparable to the sanctions imposed on COSCO shipping for transporting Iranian crude in 2019, where rates soared 3-4x. Secondary sanctions, in which entities dealing with a sanctioned country or entity are in turn sanctioned, similar to those imposed on Iran, would likely be too disruptive to the global oil market. We estimate that such sanctions would require an immediate surge in prices to levels that would destroy potentially more than 3m b/d of ex-China oil exports. A potential retaliation on Russian gas exports would also likely prevent the imposition of sanctions on oil.",

So it's an inward remittance and to let you know these are tax free if receiver is close family member. So atleast the 40k you are receiving is tax free :) But... there will be tax provision for gains generated by investing that money, so to cut it short if your yearly gains(realised, i.e. profit after selling shares) from investment are more than your tax slab then you'll have to file ITR else no need.",

If you are on the wrong side of IT regulations please keep in mind they will not only collect *all* pending taxes but can also impose penalty as well as charge interest on the outstanding + penalty amount. Also, if I recall accurately, in IT cases guilt is presumed i.e. your case will proceed with the assumption that you have evaded taxes and the onus would be on you to prove innocence.

This chart should be viewed along the lines of basic MaxPain Theory. As per MaxPain theory, stock or index will expire at the point where it gives maximum pain to option buyers. So if spot price is close to MaxPain, wait for the direction to trade. But if price is too far away from MaxPain, then we need to look for reversal trades. We can take reversal trades if price forms reversal patterns (like engulfing, doji) too far away from MaxPain. This will help us to get into the trend reversal trades early.
