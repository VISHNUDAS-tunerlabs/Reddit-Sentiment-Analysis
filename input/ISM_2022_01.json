      "I think you haven't heard famous gujrati quote \" Bhav Bhagwan Che\". Basically It Means that If You Buy Awesome Stock At High levels, it will give you negative returns. For example: If you buy Reliance shares at 2800 then obviously you will be in loss. And if you bought loss making company like Idea at 10 rupees it will give you 50% returns. The key here is to buy shares at support zones on daily, weekly time frame. Since you are a beginner, it's not your fault, you should have learnt first before investing huge amount. And if you still don't get it. You can always buy mutual funds and ETFs. They have fund managers who manages your fund. I think all the stocks you have bought are good. What you bought at very high prices. And then you got stuck when Nifty started falling. So now you can do SIP and average your position. Or you can wait till all start giving you positive returns. If I were in your position then I would have bought the dips and average or waited till stock started giving good returns. Because all these stocks are fundamentally strong. &amp; from now only buy at supports. On December 20, when Nifty made bottom, all the stocks were at dip/supports. Some even broke supports. That's when I do huge investment. Otherwise I don't buy 1 Lacs worth of share when everything you see is overpriced. Then I Only Buy Those Shares Which Make Patterns &amp; Give Breakouts On Weekly Timeframe. If you want, you can ping me. I'll guide. &amp; Don't mind others are saying, no one has guts to show their losses, whenever someone is in beginner phase everyone book losses. That's how we all learn.",

I read annual reports and also look at employees feedback on Glassdoor. If there is some product on eCommerce then I see Amazon and Flipkart reviews also. I try to find reason to reject stock.

      "Actually no.. if you are doing ACTIVE investing, then investing in more than 20 stocks doesn't give you any advantage. People invest in more than 1 stock to diversify and reduce unsystematic risk of their portfolio. As per data, if u r invested in 20 stocks ( which shouldn't have highly correlated returns) you have hedged the maximum risk u can. Post that, u invest in 30,50,100 stocks.. the risk remains the same. You are just increasing your workload in tracking all those stocks. When it comes to investing in Nifty 50, that's a PASSIVE style of investing. You invest in the index because it is naturally upward biased. If a company doesn't do well, it automatically moves out of the index and a new company comes in. So yeah, that's the difference.",

If you want even more accountability you can take part in competitions that are held worldwide on market simulation. One such competition I can suggest you is Wolves of Wall Street Challenge. The challenge is launched by Harvard Student Agencies at Harvard University and even gives you access to mentorship to learn directly from people in the field and then curate your portfolio on simulation. The winner even stands a chance to win $1000 which I see as win win. You can join the competition through the website learnwithleaders.com/wolvesofwallstreet.

Besides, classic value investing is not a long-term strategy. Even Warren Buffet barely holds stocks longer than 1Y. (Source: https://seekingalpha.com/article/394891-the-myth-of-buffett-buy-and-hold) ------- When I was new to stocks, people told me that value investing is dead. NONSENSE. Buying wonderful companies (moat) at a fair price is what I call value growth investing. It requires doing gambling on future cash flows into the business. I am 100% confident that even CEOs themselves can not estimate future cash flows. And there is only 2% of 4000+ stocks which have economic moat which is also too expensive by any measure of value. ---- I am a practitioner of value momentum investing. I don't use PE + NCAV but a different method. It's called operating earnings yield (revenue - the cost of doing business) and measured against the enterprise value (market cap + debt + new share issue - cash &amp; cash equivalents). After filtering for liquidity, I shortlist stocks based on the highest operating earnings yield (maximum 3.5x multiple). Then out of the top 10% of such cheap stocks I buy the top 10 positions which have the highest previous year return and hold for 1Y + 1D. I rebuild this portfolio every year (1st week of January). I also go full cash when the return of NIFTY over the last 10 months is below the repo rate. I never invest more than 75% of my portfolio and never less than 35%. I have avoided the 2011 and 2015 bear markets and beaten SENSEX by 3%.

So there is no guarantee that in the next 3Y, retail investors will make more than FD or less than FD, but one of these two scenarios is possible. The market is always full of second-order uncertainty (how uncertain an event is also uncertain) and everyone is speculating on future capital appreciation based on the CAPM model built on basis of EMH. SIP strategy is a modified version of the martingale strategy, where the strategy assumed the market always has to go up, hence allocating symmetrical bets over periods will normalize the uncertainties of volatility. But all of these are curve-fitting academic assumptions.

      "In the case of holding put options till expiry and then having to do physical settlement, the risks are unlimited as one can not predict how high the stock will land above the strike price, it could run 1%, 10%, 20% depending on any surprises like good results, positive news, mergers, acquisitions, government policy change etc. In simple words, your losses are not capped as they are for options expiring OTM which is the loss of total premium plus any broker charges. This is true for put options only. A number of things are in play here: 1. Last traded price vs. Closing Price - The buyer thought he was OTM as per last traded price but was ITM as options are based on closing price not last traded price. The closing price is the weighted average of price across all exchanges for the given underlier in the last 30 minutes 2. Price volatility in final hours made the closing price ITM 3. Understanding of Physical settlement in case of options expiring ITM in the Indian market - If options expire ITM then the option holder has to honour the commitment, it's no longer an obligation 4. Liquidity of the option - Not many buyers for this option in the market in the final hours so the holder was left holding the option until the expiry.

      "All the IPOs due this year are bringing a positive change in the market sentiments. Investors are looking forward for these IPOs and the response is going to be very good. For Oyo, I think it is going to be a game changer as now it is a big brand in the hotel industry with a great reach even in the small cities. The upcoming IPO will make the company stronger and would help in expanding further.",
      "Blockbuster or not, but the upcoming IPO for Oyo is a wise move for the company from their objective‚Äôs perspective. The company has been expanding aggressively in past few years and the aim to expand further. That will require more resources and IPO is a good option to get that funding. With the current expectation to raise 8,430 crores, Oyo is set to fulfill its objective and follow the path of growth.",

So, the upcoming IPO for Oyo is going to bring a lot of positivity in the travel industry, and I am looking forward to this.",

      "In my point of view, Oyo is a huge and largely successful brand from a long time and has gained customers‚Äô trust by now. So, there is no doubt that its IPO would be welcomed by both the investors and customers with full support. This company should expand further and serve better after their IPO. So, I am positive with the changes that are expected to happen this year with respect to its IPO.",

Well the sector is definitely underpenetrated, and it *seems* like a huge opportunity (if you expect credit cards to grow to USA levels eventually)But every single person I know who has ever used a credit card (including myself) has left with a bitter taste in their mouth. The whole credit card business model revolves around being unethical, so idk how much longer they can sustain themselves if regulations become tighter (eg. limits on interest rates and hidden fees) I feel like growth is currently coming from naive people who don't really know how awful credit cards are - sooner or later everyone will know it - this combined with BNPL and other new fintech will make it difficult for the industry to grow But then again - Parimal has suggested that SBI Card has multibagger potential - and he is never wrong when he says that - look at his other multibagger predictions like KPIT, Trident So... maybe it's a good medium term buy (i.e. hold less than 5 yrs)",

      "Don't simply go by 1 report, even if it is by a big international brokerage. Macquarie today had a target price of Rs. 1230 for SBI cards. It's best to understand what each of them are saying and then make your own decision. Here is what the GS report says: Triple challenges ahead: Despite 6ppt share gains in spends over FY17-2HFY22, an increase in credit losses (11% in FY21 vs 4%/2% for HDBK/ICBK credit card/unsecured loans) suggests structural challenges in new-to-credit-card customers which is set to intensify on rising competition. We expect earnings growth to moderate to 18% in FY22-25E vs 27% in FY17-21 on: 1. Increasing popularity of alternates like Buy-Now-Pay-Later; we est. BNPL FY26E TAM of US$35bn (13% of credit spends) 2. Regulatory changes such as challenge to MDR/interchange rate which could potentially impact fees (c.50% of revenues) 3. Competition from capital-rich fintechs and banks putting upward pressure on marketing/reward management expenses (75% of PPOP), thereby resulting in widening operating jaws. Even the upside from SBI appears relatively overstated due to lower spends and higher attrition in SBI customer pool. Valuations rich; GS net profit is 25% below consensus: We expect operating leverage to be negative on competitive/regulatory headwinds. Valuation of 46.0x/8.9x FY23E EPS/BVPS appears rich on a relative basis vs our coverage as well as per our RIM analysis. Key upside risks: (1) improvement in op. leverage; (2) better asset quality performance; (3) share gains along with better profitability.",

But if the stock falls or if it goes tits up and I wanna EXIT then it charges taxes, equity charges and profit/loss charges, transaction charge which would roughly be 16 re for 1 stock , so for 10 stock = 10√ó16 = 160+ 10(entry)= 170, therfore out of 500 capital 170 is itself gone poof in charges.

It is fine to start with low capital but you are only buying one to two share of each company. when and if company goes into bull run your percent profit for that stock would be high but overall cash would be low. So my advice would be to cut your loss on some stocks research about fine stocks or bet on safe stocks like TCS or other sectors which are projected to do great in near future. Also easier to sell and monitor stocks when they are less. Also script you buy and sell you have to pay STT charges on them. which could add up. so having a 5 script(company ) of 50 shares is better than having 20 scripts of 5 shares(charges wise).",

      "None of the FMCGs have a product moat. Pick any product from HUL or ITC's portfolio and there is at least one alternative. The sector is and will always be hypercompetitive that way. But I feel Amrutanjan has a brand moat, they are over 100 years old and the level of trust in their core market (south) is deep. It's a household name for some there. You are right about Amrutanjan's core product not being welcomed by the youth segment. But see that's the Tier 1 &amp; 2 urban youth. Youngsters in small towns and rural areas have a very different perspective, even buying Patanjali products. My friends in Mumbai may laugh at Ramdev's antics but my cousins in Karnataka buy his honey and soap. Anyway Amrutanjan has been slowly diversifying for the past \\~20 years. Future growth will not come from balm, it will come from low cost sanitary pads, healthy juices etc. One thing I liked about them is that they avoid debt. They always reinvest their own money for expansion. Regarding your first question -&gt; my portfolio is almost 50% FMCG. But this is not ideal, it was forced on me as I inherited FMCG shares from my dad. I am slowly selling off and buying tech, banking, pharma, chemicals, aircon. Edit: end goal is to keep FMCG at around 15-20% of my portfolio.",

Never naked sell a option. Suppose Nifty Spot is 18200 and you sold Nifty 19000 JAN CE then do buy another option at 19100/19200 so that your losses are limited.It will also reduce your capital requirement. 5. Take a break from trading if continuously making losses and/or you have reached the limit of capital drawdown (say 50%) you can bear. 6. Never carry stock options till expiry because ITM stock options have physical delivery clause. 7. Keep track of market development which might affect a particular sector or overall markets. Exit trades if original trade assumptions changes. 8. Paper trade your strategies before live trading. 9. If your mental health if being affected due to unrealised losses , option trading might not be right for you. 10. Supplement option selling with equity(cash market) investing for long-term. 11. Be extra cautious in times of high volatility like election results, company results. P.S: I will add points if I recall something more.

Patterns I'll enter a trade when the R:R ratio is optimal i.e. at the swing when price action is supporting the move. And I exit the trade when I see a change in the pattern.

They have restructured a big chunk of their debt and they are now winning projects. An uptrend in revenues plus their finance cost being under control is what I would be looking at in the coming years. If you see consistent improvement - you can put in some money (that you are fine with losing). I bought 10k shares at 2.85/- (dirt cheap) and I don‚Äôt regret buying it.

      "Yes. Do remember that Buffet, Jhunjhunwala have become big after crossing their 50s and they have started early. So it depends on when you start, careful stock selection after you are in and staying put if stock still is fundamentally sound. It is better to go for value investing as against trading if you are thinking of long term wealth. To quote my own example. I retired as SSC armed forces officer (saying only for the purpose of context). I couldn't invest in equities while in service. After 12 years, I retired without pension, but while in service I was forced to deposit approximately 18k per month into defence PF and insurance. On retirement, this amount stood approx 20L. Partly helped by market fall, I entered market with this amount between April 2020 to August 2020. I bought big chunk of large caps like Infosys, Reliance, Nifty ETF, Abbot, Nestle, Brittania, Biocon as my moat. Remaining I bought Affle, ion exchange, Happiest Minds (bit later), Philips carbon, Sterlite, Berger paints. The big guys gave a around 80 return collectively, but some like Biocon floundered. But the small and mid caps like Affle and Happiest Minds gave nearly 3 times the entering price. Although even here companies like iolcp, alembic pharma failed. Today, with some more money infusion, my asset stands at 66 L. I exited companies that exhibited poor leadership like Biocon and IRCTC, and some FMCG companies due poor sales, but bulk of the companies in the portfolio never changed. So in 14 years, despite entering equity pretty late, I have come from 0 to 67L in equity. Not comparable with RK, Buffet for obvious reasons, but I think with the current wisdom in hindsight, had I started early with little sip into some the good companies, I would have been happily sitting in 1 cr plus. I also regret investing into real estate, which severely limited by equity investments during my service days (through my spouses account). The fact that I will never get to stay in the house I bought is infuriating. You have not defined what 'big in the market' means, but I compared myself with my contemporaries and I can say relatively i am big. I leave it to you to draw better inference. I admit luck and timing helped me at times. But I did apply some wisdom where it was necessary. I have a fixed target in my mind, on reaching which I would consider myself financial free. Sip helps, entering early helps and careful selection of companies in the portfolio helps.",

Banknifty options day trading is what i do and recommend but again , it is very risky and you can lose all the capitql in a single trade if you don't put a sl or on a continuous sl streak.

      "I understand that pain. I would suggest a simple exercise. Calculate what amount defines your financial freedom and how many years you intend to work. For example, a 24 years old Kumar, wants to retire at 50 and considers 7.7 crores (roughly present day 1million USD) as viable equity to sustain him for rest of his life. He has 2 lakhs at the moment as base amount and has 26 years to attain his target. Assuming a cagr of his equity at 20 percent, he has to put 8k per month for every month for 26 years. You can use online compound interest calculator at investor.gov to calculate what is applicable for you. You will also realise that starting early makes big difference. Instead of 24, if Kumar's age is 34, he has only 16 years. Keeping rest of the parameters same, he would get only 1.2 crores instead of 7.7 crores. Btw, 20 percent cagr is bit optimistic for some, but I think is feasible with some carefully curated portfolio. All the best on the career front and remember to read books on the value investing.",

Keep your portfolio concentrated if your not comfortable with big bets, my only advice will be that learn everyday about stock markets and if you want to take risks or you're in the stock market for long run go with good small, mid cap companies with good fundamentals.",

Blue chip stocks are stable (usually IT sector), when considering long term. Again long term means anywhere between 5+ years to 20+ years. In between you keep reviewing and distribute weightage accordingly.",

Unlike traditional power, renewable like solar and wind are not constant power source but needs storing. Battery is our current option but lithium ion battery can't be an option for large storage when demand spike. Sodium ion battery do provide better alternative but still maintenance wud be a constant concern. This is where hydrogen fuel comes into play. They provide a better alternative to renewable energy storage by converting electricity to hydrogen fuel. It provides the benefits of fossil fuel without environmental impact and produce electricity to run cars. High energy density, \"low time\" to fuel, low maintenance, low environmental impact are just few positives. Negatives : High cost is biggest. And technology is still under development. Don't have the advantages of using existing infrastructures like EV has for transmission. Overall hydrogen fuel is gonna be the future. But that's very far away. Atleast 10 years for initial adoption. The race is already on in many countries. India is also a part of it.",

It shone in a time when there was no UPI. But with UPI, wallets are dead. Yes, PayTM is another business but it's not the leader is any of those and it's competing with firms that which have that particular business as their core focus. (For example, competing with Zerodha in brokerage). Having said that, I'm a fundamentals-oriented long term investment person. So their might be a bounce before March as someone said but long-term I see no way PayTM can survive with their current model. Their best shot is to get acquired but even then I don't have too much hopes for the share as it's a digital company without hardly any solid assets (It's book value is 96). In fact, (and call me conservative, ok) for long term I am not very bullish on what new-age FinTech startups could do. There is too much competition for them to turn good earnings, and I don't see them getting a banking license to make money from large credit offerings. In few years, whatever technological edge they bring would also be accumulated by the bigger banks in their tech offerings (ICICI). But again, it depends on the investment horizon.",

Whereas for a large cap fund it's returns are more important than the AUM.( Mainly because the large cap companies are expensive) Case in point - Axis Bluechip fund has an AUM of about 33k crore.",
      "Are you aiming for Midcaps and smallcaps? For long term i would suggest to give more weightage to Large caps / bluechip ones. Trim your portfolio and snip out the non-performers.

But even before you do do that, make sure you got yourself a 1. Health Insurance 2. Term Life Insurance 3. 6 months of your living expenses in a FD. A lot of times Equity will go down and you will simply have to wait for some time for it to be up again. So you typically want to invest only the amount that you don't need in case at a short notice. Something you can keep away for a while. Once you have started with index funds, you may simply say that's it or you can chose to deep dive into investing in direct stocks.

You can easily get 10-20% returns yearly. If you have time, will and desire to learn about stocks, then that'd even better. You can pick your own stocks and start investing with small to get started. Everyone in the stock market is to make money with good returns, and the only way to do that is to buy low sell high. It is important to analyze any stock in detail if you want to invest directly. It might look intimidating, but its not so hard. Yes, it takes time and you have study many different topics such company financials, ratios, growth prospects, shareholdings, cash flow, etc. Any company price rise is entirely dependent on companies future growth, prices may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments, but in the long run, its the profit growth that matters. As companies become financially strong and grow consistently, they are able to reduce their debts and expand their business which results in more growth. Without learning, none of it is possible.

      "Zomato made an exceptional debut on exchanges in July 2021. The Zomato share was issued at Rs 76 per share, and it opened with a 65% premium at Rs 126. It touched a lifetime high of Rs 169 on 15 November. However, post-November, the stock has taken a downward trajectory. Since Jan 2022, the stock has fallen close to 33%. Talking about results: The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 310 crore as compared with Rs 170 crore in the previous quarter. Adjusted revenue grew 22.6% quarter-on-quarter at Rs 1,420 crore. Below are some reasons for the falling share price: The overall market fall - Zomato stock has fallen 18.6% today. One of the prime reasons for it is overall negative sentiment in the market. Nifty50 has fallen 3.5% in the same period. Pressure on tech stocks - The recent report on Fed rolling back liquidity because of high inflation in the US has weakened the case for investment in overpriced technology stocks that have no near-term profitability visibility. The shares of other non-profitable tech companies like Paytm, CarTrade, Fino Payments Bank have fallen between 10% and 50% from their respective listing price in the last couple of months. New GST rule - The new GST rules that came into effect from 1 January have made food delivery apps liable to pay 5% tax on restaurant services provided by them. It will impact the company in one way or the other. JP Morgan, in its recent report compared Zomato and Swiggy, and its findings showed Zomato lagging behind Swiggy. The report suggested: &amp;#x200B; * Zomato has a thinner Metro restaurant network and density compared to Swiggy. * There is higher restaurant exclusivity than expected with Swiggy leading at 56% and Zomato at 45%, supporting higher take-rates. * Zomato has higher discounts, suggesting higher aggression adversely impacting contribution margins. * Swiggy casts a wider net with a longer service radius expanding customer selection that can help it build/retain leadership. Zomato has a median price target of Rs 166 in 12 months by 17 analysts. The most bullish forecast for the stock is Rs 220, while the most bearish share price target is Rs 90. &amp;#x200B; We published a detailed report at [https://www.indmoney.com/articles/zomato-share-price-update](https://www.indmoney.com/articles/zomato-share-price-update) highlighting the above.

      "Firstly you need a minimum capital of 10,000 to trade at the money options. As a beginner, options will lure you into its vicious trap by making your money double, even triple in a few days itself (beginners luck).. After that you'll soon find yourself falling into a bottomless pit day after day once options begins to show it's true nature by wiping off not just your initial profits but your entire capital in a few weeks itself. Then you'll plan revenge and invest more only to lose all of it again and the cycle will go on till you've lost not just all your money but also your mind and sanity. Trust me, I've lost over 7 lakhs trading nifty and bank nifty options in just 2 months (after making a profit of 2 lakhs in the first few weeks). Sorry for the long post but i would strongly advise to stay the hell away from F &amp; O and focus on holdings atleast till you've spent a minimum of 2 years in the market. Baaki aapki marzi bro.",

      "Paper trading means you are watching the live market on your zerodha/upstox app and when you feel that you would have entered a trade (call or put) you mark your entry level on a paper. Eg : Nifty 17000 Ce entry at 300rs. You plan your stop loss (eg 250rs) and take profit (eg 400rs) and watch if the live trade hits your stop loss or your take profit level. There are some apps like moneybhai, sensibull, trakinvest that allow paper trading on Indian markets with virtual currency. Another option if you have a day job and cannot track live market is subscribe to trading view app and use the replay button. It will play out the trade as if it were live.",
      "Oh okay. I was shocked. Hehehe. Please do send the list. I would like to analyse them.",
      "Why in loss? If you playing in options as a buyer. Don't enter early. You should keep 2 views. 1) Intraday 2) positional And, generally as an option buyer you want to buy options last two weeks. Best is last week since options looses premium more during last week. Once you say identify a stock then you need to track it everyday or set an alert. Then it gets easy to enter. DO NOT ENTER early and HOLD the option. Most stocks need a catalyst to give a big moves up or down. Maruti earnings was today. If you look charts closely your first target should be 8500. Hence say you identify strong support which was 8080 in Maruti case then further confirm with vols for a breakout. Second is, you want a strike which can turn ITM if stock gives a breakout. 8194 was confirmation stock going for a breakout (today). Been facing resistance at 8256-8276 range. Once broken with vols you could have entered 8500 CE at 25-30 range for 8500 target. 1:10 risk to reward. You should buy minimum 2 lot (up-to your risk management) Exit 1 lot at once capital plus decent profit comes. (1:3 risk to reward) and Let 1 lot run till the stock runs. Genrally, when big breakout happens as an option buyer you could avg at pullbacks for more target in Maruti it was 8500/8600 targets. But you should be more confident that it's a BREAKOUT and not a FAILED breakout. Good luck OP. Hope it helps.",

Most of the funds invest large portion in equity. Equity is preferred since its what most funds invest in. In equity also, there are large, flexi, small and multicap fund as well as sectorwise funds, such as technology, infra/power, etc. Most people go with index funds as they are large cap, bluechip stocks with stable returns. These are index funds which directly invest in indexes which includes all the stocks like sensex, nifty. You can research for each fund by their charges, expense ratio, exit load, etc. Lumpsum investment comes with higher risk -high reward since the fall and rise will affect your whole lumpsum investment, while SIP saves you that risk with rupee cost averaging where your last months investment loss is averaged with this months investment, although it will give less returns than lumpsum.",

If you have focussed PF say stocks from only 1 sector, if some crazy event happened which affects entire sector (For example, Logistics created a huge problem for Industries few months back) then you would be down drastically. So, have some good amount of diversification, especially in terms of sectors (rather than stocks) and the total number of stocks should make you comfortable rather than feel uneasy (your money and your returns, do not blindly follow some methodology or philosophy, if you are not comfortable with it, change it)",

Now as you are holding them and it has become a liability, I would suggest to take a suitable stop loss. And remember never average your losers cut them short.

      "Mine are very generic TBH. **Investment:** 1. Never invest in anything unless you have good idea from top to bottom, especially taxation and service charges etc. 2. Get rich instantly schemes are either pure luck and mostly are scams in most cases. 3. Be ready for losses , if you can't afford to loose money then don't invest because every investment comes with certain risk factor. For example I don't mind loosing everything in my crypto investments, its a bet I'm willing to take and in future it might go up or tank completely. **Savings:** 1. **Don't buy anything you don't need** , for example latest smartphone or biggest car etc. the only exception is that if you're passionate about these things like if you like driving then by all means buy that car and enjoy life , but don't buy a car to flex on others. Its better to have good saving/investments and shitty car than no savings and expensive car. Also biggest trap is Sales on Amazon etc. people say \"*I got this at discount.*\" but real question \"*do you need it to begin with ?*\" 2. **Avoid EMI's wherever you can,** for example if you wanna buy a two wheeler just save that money in bank FD or MF and later buy in cash, the only exception is that if you can generate revenue from two wheeler (like your job needs travelling etc.) then yes by all means go ahead with EMI option.",

If you aren't postive about any stock, or certain of its value, you shouldn't be invested in that stock in the first place. By next week, there will be lots of good stocks, you could invest in them and possibly recover your losses. I heard people say IPOs are the safe investment, but turns out it's not. There isn't enough information about the stock on different portals when they are listed, so it becomes very risky to actually analyse them like we can easily do for other stocks, unless you dig deep into the company financials and see how the company fares.

You can sell it and utilise this loss to save taxes in your future gains. Not a big deal. No need to average out the price even if you did have money in my humble opinion. Just don't have any regrets about your actions, whether you keep it or sell it.

The problem with short selling is we can only do it through intraday rather than comfortably swing trading across days or weeks. Intraday trading is an unpredictable and stressful thing regardless of whether we take long or short, as we rely too much on luck and stock price fluctuations. Although I made a few profits from short selling paytm through scalping in few seconds or even minutes of duration, I get cocky and lose all the profits by trying my luck on other stocks in the same day in this very volatile market. Paytm is a bit more predictable in its core trajectory due to it being a shit stock that has been falling since it‚Äôs IPO, and it being a household name means a lot of people bought into it ensuring good liquidity and volume. If you are curious, just try short selling a single stock of paytm alone. You would come to understand if it‚Äôs for you without much risk. Since intraday long/shorts are too much about gut feelings, I typically don‚Äôt recommend it to others. Regardless, I would keep trying it myself if I see potential tomorrow.

I don‚Äôt let the brokerage square it off. I mostly just do scalping sessions for a few minutes, and if profits keep rising I bring the stoploss a bit further closer to ensure at least minimum profits. I don‚Äôt put too much money into these sessions either (60k with a 5x leverage).

      "Some or even Most e-commerce businesses today, follow the business model of investing in other e-commerce, thus at the best situation making use of available synergy with the acquired business or at least by angel investing and making some returns when the invested business goes into further rounds of funding. At least that's what Infoedge did with Zomato when it went to IPO. It's also quite apparent that the CEO of Infoedge had/has mentored the CEO of zomato in this same aspect. But this is not a bad aspect, as mentioned earlier there is helpful synergy built up and some good mentoring may be passed on too. But the question is where does this go from here, especially the invested businesses. This will prominently depend on how well the invested businesses perform, how well Zomato can help, who, when &amp; for how much does it finally sell of its stake when it does and what is it's current acquisition cost of its stake. But to answer this question only time can answer. But also do mind, that we do not have the invested businesses data or balance sheet or any information. Besides this is not the first startup in which Zomato has invested or owned stake in As an investor you may have to carry many future based analysis and obtain really far off information, but one of the most important question we have to ask is, this a long term strategy or just Passing the hot potato game.",

      "Yup , only a little tho . I really hope Investopedia never goes down lol . I also did find a comment on youtube telling about the returns of this specifically wint wealth &gt;One thing that many will ignore is that it is actually quite worse then debt fund if you are able to get it with same interest rate. As interest income will be paid monthly so it will also be added into your income so if you are in 30% bracket and will always hold more then 2 years that is less then 27 months so your actual gain is around. 10.25%\\*.7=7.175. If you are able to get these return with same quality thorough debt funds then it is actually better in many place. As when we invest and are paying taxes then knowing about tax is also very important as this affect the effective return rate also Another comment by same person &gt;personally i just want to get more then fd returns as the tax in these is 20%+indexation that make it very good for all people that fall in this category. So i mainly invest in short term debt funds where capital erosion is very less just by seeing the portfolio and the rules and that is around a very nice investment and personally i really don't invest much in them not more then 20%of my wealth in them and mainly want emergency and opportunity fund so returns are not important and also want less tax on them to save accounting and other. If we see i mainly invest in kotak and icici short term funds and they both are near 8-9% returns in last 3 years. if we cut tax and take inflation to be 6% then the tax cut returns will be around. 8.1-8.4% return rate if we take 8.5 to 9% returns. Also note how much time you want to hold is important as long term in them is only 3 years and if these funds also give these 20%+indexation then these are a better bet else the numbers are there which are better just calculate.

      "I agree with you on Zomato but how Nykaa is a gold mine because Nykaa buys the product straight from the manufacturer and in case of Amazon &amp; Reliance as they &gt;they start manufacturing their own products Started making there own products with the help of Consumer Data like Amazon has Solimo and Reliance has Jio &amp; other brands. The thing is in Amazon it is a service provider for B2C and same with Reliance Ajio. But I'll keep Reliance aside and in Amazon different businesses register their shop and you know in Flipkart and Sometimes in Amazon you get duplicate products but in Case of Nykaa they directly pickup from the manufacturer and sells to the Customer so there are no chance of fake/duplicate product. Still Other companies are also fighting for this issue and maybe in future thinks will be different btw who knows.",

      "actually yeah. The stakeholders; as the people invested in a company are called, are specifically barred from making claims in public statements that might affect the share price directly... as this changes the free float market capitalisation of the company... and hence the entire market.... which in turn is the meter for a country's quality of economy. Indias 3 trillion economy means the return of nations entire Industry. And the sum of capitalisation of all the companies listed on the stock exchange equals a sum of about 3 trillion dollars, which means how kuch money is standing in currently. A ratio od these two means jow bubbled up the economy is. A higher value is generally not preferred hence the domino effect results in a curb of these announcements to be made at all. On 26 jan market cap was 3.126 trillion and on 28,( I'm using NSE) it was 3.11 trillion. I could not get the data for 21 companies though. (1775 total as of last check 2 weeks ago) The evaluation will be deemed real only once Google actually puts money inn... so they can't announce the dates as people will push up the valuation. Also, Google would want to buy the company for the lowest valuation as it gives the largest slice for N amount. So MOSTLY in the investment contract there are clauses tk not hamper the evaluation by these means. Corporate meeting are VERY VERY legally bound from both sides all over the world.",
      "Yes, that what I said. Everyone knows what Nykaa does. Anytime Nykaa starts capturing more market, big players like Reliance and Amazon can take over Nykaa msp and start storing products purchased directly from brands. They don't have warehouse issue. That's why Nykaa is a very risky bet.",

On a side note: There is no fixed compounding on mutual funds either, its just price averaging by buying every few months. Consider a situation if the market falls and the mutual funds which have the underlying asset of the index or specific stocks which have fallen also slip in price(NAV), then whatever price has increased will not matter, it will all or some parts of it be wiped out. Unlike ppf or fd where your compounded interest is guaranteed year on year, the compound on stocks and mutual funds is not guaranteed and is completely dependent on the underlying asset growth in price.",

      "Yes you cant use it for stocks as there is no fixed compounding happening. Let‚Äôs call it dynamic compounding. This will be better to explain it to you. Consider u put 10k in mutual funds and get lets say 10 percent interest end of year. Now you dont take out the interest for use. Let it stay there. So unlike a PPF fixed interest rate compound where whatever is final balance that will be used for next year‚Äôs interest calculation, in dynamic compounding (mutual funds) nothing is fixed and completely based on underlying price of stocks involved in the fund and the NAV of mutual fund. I said dynamic cause if NAV at the start of the year is 100 it can easily come to 95 giving negative returns. So forget compounding you wont even get base invested value. Same logic in stocks, as there is a last traded price, use this price logic similar to NAV of mutual fund.",

Also buffet says this about the US market and not about international markets. Every market is different, the US is much more mature and good investors know that solid index funds work well to give returns. Some hyper progressive index funds have failed also like nikkei. So just cause Buffet says something dont try to apply it directly to the Indian market.",

Here is the link for all the stocks by sector: [https://www.screener.in/explore/](https://www.screener.in/explore/) Here are some additional things I look at when picking up stocks \\- Market Cap should be more than 100cr. \\- Growing OPM% and net profit, with increasing EPS YOY or quarter to quarter \\- Low PE or similar compared to peers, sector and index \\- ROE &amp; ROCE should be more than 10, above 20 is preferred \\- Increasing book value with low PB ratio. \\- Low debt with high interest coverage. Debt to equity less than 1. \\- Sufficient cash flow to cover all the expenses if becomes due. \\- Last 3 year combined net profit more than 10% \\- Promoter holding preferably more than 50%. Very low or no pledging of shares. \\- Should not have low volumes in trading or delivery. High delivery volume preferred. \\- Company management should be efficient and able to handle business well. You can find out from their business model, by reading their financials and the way they have been doing business. These are just some of the things to look for. However, there are some stocks which do not meet these criteria, it doesn't mean that they are bad, some companies take time to build a good value and business which later reflects in their stock analysis.",

      "I bought it during IPO, got at Rs. 76 per share. I had the opportunity to sell at 150-160 level in Nov to make 2x returns. Reasons I didn't sell \\- Limited competition unlike other startups like Paytm/PB (only Swiggy) \\- Good brand and marketing esp. among youngsters and startups (Brands are a big deal imo) \\- It is (or will become) more than food delivery (dine-in menus, restaurant reviews, corporate meals, hyper pure, cloud kitchen etc.) so they have some options if food delivery business doesn't go well \\- InfoEdge (Sanjeev Bikhchandani) is mentor and investor (they are very experienced in Indian consumer internet and in stock market as well) \\- Hype (as retail participation grows in coming years, many teen nibbas and nibbis will buy Zomato no matter what cuz of brand and these youtubers/telegramers) Risks \\- If Swiggy (or some other company) wins the race (50% risk at-least) \\- Valuation risk (even if it wins and becomes profitable it will take years to justify its valuations) \\- Revolt from restaurant partners (but can happen to anyone even Swiggy) \\- Founder/promoter concerns (I am not sure if Deepi is here to make a quick buck or is here for the long game as I personally don't trust these startup founders much and they may start selling their shares once their lock in period is over) So its a 50-50 bet according to me. But I am following Dhandho strategy here. ‚ÄúHeads I win, Tails I do not lose much‚Äù If it goes wrong I may lose the small amount I invested in IPO (\\~15k) but If it wins will become few lacs at least in a decade or two.",

Also for food delivery apps if they need to show profit they need to cut down on discounts and free deliveries, coupons and codes. What stopped Uber Eats? But if they cut down, competitors ( like swiggy) will gain upper hand. So i doubt about profits here. Dont know maybe i am wrong but still am not comfortable.",

      "Axis is really good buy if you got it below 750 like OP!",
      "You're welcome. Good luck to both of us! Also its easier to keep an eye on these popular brands - they are always in news and mainstream media. People will discuss about them always (like you and me are discussing it here) and you get to know various perspectives - both good or bad. Compared to other small cap bets I made (also got via IPOs) where I don't get any updates and no discussion about them anywhere. There is nothing at all other than average quarterly updates. Even I don't know what to do in those cases where I am struck.",

These charges takes up a pretty decent chunk on ur returns when u calculate the cumulative on each stock u trade on. I moved to zerodha when I realised it.

Plus it is winning a lot of projects especially in solar. Adani Green is good but it's too expensive. Plus the company is running on debt. It doesn't have any cash reserves on hand. Though in last 1.5 years, it is beating Tata power in terms of sales. It is expanding a lot. Personally I don't like it. But it is a future oriented stock. It have worked on India's largest solar power park. One more thing about Adani Green is that domestic investors and mutual fund don't invest in it. Mostly foreign investors are investing. Personally bse and Tata Power is great. Adani green is good but personally I will not invest in it. Though I used to have it. I bought it at 1000 and sold it at 1350.",

Learn about money management 7. Learn about risk management 8. Learn about position sizing These are on top of mind. We are retail traders looking to have a small edge than rest of the traders.
